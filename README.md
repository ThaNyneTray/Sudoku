### Sudoku
My attempt at a Sudoku application with GUI capabilities  
Implemented in PyQT5 - currently in progress  
Expect photos and demos soon.

#### TODO:
* ~~Implement backend logic~~
* ~~Implement grid GUI~~
* ~~Implement buttons to clear, solve, reset, get new board and show hints~~
* Draw grid box lines
* Change left arrow key functionality to be able to move out of a cell when it's in edit mode
* Extend solve implementation to show the backtracking algorithm in action.
* Extend "How Am I Doing" button to highlight placements that will lead to a non-solution
* Add a timer to the puzzle, and with it add a pause button
    + Once the user clicks pause, the screen is obscured by random
    letters, so that the user is not cheating.
* Allow the user to save the puzzles they have solved.
* Add another window showing the statistics, and possibly a 
graph that maps puzzle solved to time taken conditioned on
difficulty.
* Allow the user to change difficulty
