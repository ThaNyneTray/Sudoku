### Sudoku
My attempt at a Sudoku application with GUI capabilities  
Implemented in PyQT5 - currently in progress  
Expect photos and demos soon.

#### TODO:
* ~~Implement backend logic~~
* ~~Implement grid GUI~~
* ~~Implement buttons to clear, solve, reset, get new board and show hints~~
* Draw grid box lines
* Change left arrow key functionality to be able to move out of a cell when it's in edit mode
* Extend solve implementation to show the backtracking algorithm in action.
* Extend "How Am I Doing" button to highlight placements that will lead to a non-solution
